/**
 * Represents a single annotation item of an {@link IAnnotationStudy}.
 * Note that the definition of an annotation item depends on the annotation
 * setup: In coding tasks, annotation items are fixed, and each rater is
 * asked to code each item. The category assigned by a certain rater is 
 * represented as annotation units. Thus, an annotation item of a coding
 * study consists of multiple annotation units. In unitizing studies, there
 * is no fixed definition of an item. The items roughly correspond to the
 * smallest possible segments within the continuum of the study. Theoretically,
 * an item would thus allow accessing the identified annotation units at a
 * specific position of the continuum. For efficiency reasons, this is, 
 * however, not explicitly modeled.
