/**
 * Generic interface to be implemented by all inter-rater agreement measures 
 * that perform a chance correction and thus distinguish between observed
 * agreement and expected agreement. The basic idea is that if raters made 
 * a random decision on each annotation unit, then the final inter-rater 
 * agreement should be zero. See also {@link IChanceCorrectedDisagreement}
 * for the analogous definition of chance corrected measures with observed
 * and expected disagreement.<br><br>
