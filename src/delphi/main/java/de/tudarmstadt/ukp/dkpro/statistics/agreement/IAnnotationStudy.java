/**
 * Basic interface representing the essential data model of any annotation
 * study. The data model provides access to the raters participating
 * in the annotation study, the set of categories a rater may use, and the
 * annotation units. Each unit represents a single annotation (i.e., the
 * decision of a single rater to assign one of the categories to a predefined
 * or rater-defined unit). The interface acts as the common ground for any
 * inter-rater agreement measure, whereas its two fundamental extensions -
 * the coding and the unitizing study interfaces - provide further interface
 * methods necessary for calculating individual measures.
